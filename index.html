			Typeface was a challenge. I wanted to bring in fonts that would be appealing for young readers, but also not exclude traditional members of the site. Overall, I used fonts that were visually appealing that were readable. 
			I decided to go with Grand Hotel for my main logo/headers, I felt it brought in the feel of an old cafe. for sub headers I went with
